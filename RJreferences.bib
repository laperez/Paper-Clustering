abstract = {In this paper, a clustering algorithm is proposed that dynamically determines the locations of fog nodes in 5G wireless networks, which are upgraded from small cells, in order to maximize throughput assuming the number of fog nodes and small cells are given as a priori information. The proposed algorithm dynamically clusters the small cells around the fog nodes. The approach is based on a soft clustering model where one small cell can be connected to many fog nodes. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm significantly enhances the throughput and lowers the latency with respect to the distance-based K-means hard clustering algorithm or Voronoi tessellation model.},

abstract = {As with many other sectors the amount of agriculture data based are increasing on a daily basis. However, the application of data mining methods and techniques to discover new insights or knowledge is a relatively a novel research area. In this paper we provide a brief review of a variety of Data Mining techniques that have been applied to model data from or about the agricultural domain. The Data Mining techniques applied on Agricultural data include k-means, bi clustering, k nearest neighbor, Neural Networks (NN) Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier and Fuzzy c-means. As can be seen the appropriateness of data mining techniques is to a certain extent determined by the different types of agricultural data or the problems being addressed. This survey summarizes the application of data mining techniques and predictive modeling application in the agriculture field.},

We devised a method called {\textquotedblleft}affinity propagation,{\textquotedblright} which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

However, it is not adequate for noisy images and it also takes more  time for execution as compared to other method as K-means. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to improve these weaknesses.
Method like Possibilistic C-Means, Fuzzy Possibilistic C-Means, Robust Fuzzy Possibilistic C-Means and Fuzzy C-Means with Gustafson-Kessel algorithm. In this paper we perform a comparison of these clustering algorithms applied to feature extraction on vineyard images. Segmented images are evaluated using several quality parameters such as the rate of correctly classied area and runtime}

For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.Availability: The software is available as supplementary material.Contact:hskim@cc.gatech.edu, hpark@acc.gatech.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = {Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters.},
